# SMARTBOT
An open source AI chatbot and virtual assistant for Android Made using Program-ab java library from google and alicebot

Things to do:- 1)Launch Apps and do other tasks in Android ecosystems. Right now it DOES NOT WORK 2)Self learning. Right now, i am using zip extraction method to extract the bot archive to the memory every time the app starts. This has to be changed to ONE time only so that it learns from the user, how to answer to a specific question, create profiles for specific user etc. Also need to delete the less used aiml patterns and topics. 3)To add face recognition to the app so that it remembers who it is talking to. 4)Fix crashing and delayed loading and more integration of program -ab within android ecosystem. 5)Better icons and interface changes.

A huge thanks to program - ab developers
